# ActivityLens

**The essential companion for Android development.**  
ActivityLens is a powerful Android utility designed for developers, testers, and advanced users who need deeper insight into app behavior, foreground activities, and system-level interactions.

## Why ActivityLens?

ActivityLens helps you:
- Monitor foreground activities and app transitions in real time
- Debug app behavior that is not visible through standard logs
- Test overlays, accessibility-driven features, and system interactions
- Analyze how apps behave across different Android versions and devices

It is built for modern Android and focuses on transparency, performance, and developer control.

## Why APK Instead of Play Store?

ActivityLens is distributed **as a direct APK** for an important technical reason:

### Accessibility Service Limitations
Some Android devices and ROMs restrict or break **Accessibility Services** when apps are installed from the Play Store. This can cause:
- Accessibility services not appearing in system settings
- Services failing to start or stopping unexpectedly
- Limited system-level access required for ActivityLens to function correctly

Installing ActivityLens **directly via APK** ensures:
- Full and reliable Accessibility Service support
- Proper system permissions on affected devices
- Consistent behavior across OEM-modified Android versions

This approach avoids manufacturer and Play Store policy limitations that interfere with advanced developer tools.
